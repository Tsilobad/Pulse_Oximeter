# Pulse_Oximeter
A basic pulse oximeter using Arduino to measure a person's heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels

Currently, the project has been initialized to a simple program that turns the Green LED ON whenever the Blue Button on the board is pressed.

Steps:
1.) Connect an LCD to the NUCLEO board, and have the board display a message on the LCD whenever the blue button is pressed
2.) Connect the MAX30100 to the NUCLEO board, and figure out how to send information to the STM32
3.) Display the obtained information on the LCD
4.) Create a 'memory' system so that you can see what previous MAX30100 measurments were
5.) Create a very primitive log-in system that allows you to take your own measurments, as well as view your own history
6.) Get an A+ :)
